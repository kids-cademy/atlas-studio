	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>${app_name} is a release from a collection of applications named Atlas. Perhaps the name is pretentious or even misleading. Is not on purpose. We really did not found a better one.</p>
	<p>In a nutshell Atlas is a quick reference on a particular subject. It is focused on facts, with reasonable amount of text and media content. It is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to be used as a quick reference on a particular subject or field. For complete reference one can visit external sources that are linked on every article.</p>
	<p>Atlas is completely free. Free of annoying ads, no misleading in-app payment, no spy-ware. Development effort is donated. It is a humble way to show gratitude to Internet community that gives us all so much.</p>
	<p>Atlas is distributed under Apache License 2.0, the same used by Android. This basically means anyone can do anything with application and sources but no warranty from kids (a)cademy. Source code on https://github.com/kids-cademy/.</p>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Atlas does not collect any data of any kind about user or device.</p>
	<h2>External Sources</h2>
	<p>Atlas does contain links to other sites. Every article has references to external sources, used when compiled article content, and made available for further readings. </p>
	<p>All external links are grouped on external sources section, at the article end. When click on external sources link, you will be directed to related site.

	<h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
	<p>Atlas is not designed specifically for children under the age of 13 but, hopefully, Atlas articles may rise interest to younger readers. Atlas content is compiled from Internet sources and tries to be neutral and does not use strong vocabulary.</p>
	<p>Anyway, since Atlas is open source and distributed under Apache License 2.0 there is no guarantee from kids (a)cademy regarding information accuracy or usability for any particular scope.   </p>
