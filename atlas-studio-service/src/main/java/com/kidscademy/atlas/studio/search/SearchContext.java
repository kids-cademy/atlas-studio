/**
 * A collection, library, data source, or repository of similar objects on which

 * is created. Since there is a bijective relation between objects and direct
 * indices, direct index is also named object index.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to create a single, mixed, search index for multiple
 * search contextes.
