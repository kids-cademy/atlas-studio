		<p>African lion is a big cat with short, tawny colored fur and white under parts.</p>
		<p>The long tail ends with a black tuft.</p>
		<p>The lions display sexual dimorphism, with males having their characteristic manes, of color ranging from black to blond.</p>
		<p>They develop their manes at the age of 3 years.</p>
		<p>Anyway, manes of the lions living in open areas, are visibly fuller.</p>
		<p>The mane makes lion look much larger than it is, helping the animal intimidate the opponent during confrontations with other lions, as well the Spotted Hyena, which is the animal's primary competitor throughout its range.</p>
		<p>Young lions have grayish coat, covered with brown markings, which then disappear by the age of 3 months.</p>
		<p>However, lions in eastern Africa tend to retain these spots on their stomach.</p>
