<section name="behavior">
	<p>The American goldfinch flies in a distinctive, following an undulating pattern, in a path resembling a wave.</p>
	<p>This consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird, then folding the wings while gliding in an arc, before repeating this sequence.</p>
	<p>Birds often vocalize during the ascending phase and then move silently during the gliding phase.</p>
	<p>
		The call made during flight is <em>per-twee-twee-twee</em>, or <em>ti-di-di-di</em>, punctuated by the silent periods.
