Insects, which make up the majority of this bird\'s diet, are caught either on the surface of the water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.</p><p>Although it generally avoids flight, the black-necked grebe travels as far as 6,000 kilometres (3,700 mi) during migration. In addition, it becomes flightless for two months after completing a migration to reach an area where it can safely moult. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migrations to reach these areas are dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a least concern species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is likely that this is the most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall

ago.','<text><section name=\"text\"><p>It was a medium-sized predator.</p><p>Streptospondylus was one of the first dinosaurs collected and was the first described, though not the first dinosaur named.</p><p>It was not recognised as a theropod dinosaur until 2001.</p><p>In 1778, abbey Charles Bacheley (1716-1795), a Norman naturalist, reported the presence of fossil bones in the Callovo-Oxfordian formations, either the Marnes de Dives or the overlying Marnes de Villers, probably the former, exposed at the foot of the Vaches Noires cliffs between Villers-sur-Mer and Houlgate.</p><p>These fossil materials contained theropod vertebrae and marine crocodilian remains.</p><p>After the death of Bacheley, his fossil cabinet was acquired by the \"Ecole centrale de Rouen\".</p><p>Louis-Benoît Guersent (1777–1848), professor of natural history in this school, drew the attention of Georges Cuvier to this remarkable fossil bones.</p><p>With the agreement of the prefect of Seine-Inférieure, count Jacques Claude Beugnot, Guersent sent the collection to the Muséum National d\'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.</p><p>In 1800, these fossils were briefly mentioned by Georges Cuvier who misspelled the name of their former owner as Bachelet.</p><p>In 1808, Cuvier scientifically described the theropod vertebrae as the first dinosaur remains ever.</p><p>However, he considered them to be crocodilian and associated them with fossils of the Teleosauridae and the Metriorhynchidae.</p><p>In 1822, Cuvier by the work of Henry De La Bèche became aware that these finds were very disparate, stemming from different periods.</p><p>He abstained from naming them but in 1824 concluded that there were two main types.</p><p>In 1825 Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire accordingly named two crocodilian skulls as the genus Steneosaurus, the one, specimen MNHN 8900, becoming Steneosaurus rostromajor, the other, MNHN 8902, S. rostrominor.</p><p>In 1832 however, the German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer split the material.</p><p>Steneosaurus rostrominor was renamed Metriorhynchus geoffroyii while Steneosaurus rostromajor became Streptospondylus altdorfensis.</p><p>To the last species the theropod remains were referred.</p><p>The generic name is derived from Greek στρεπτος/streptos, \"reversed\", and σπονδυλος/spondylos, \"vertebra\", alluding to the fact that the vertebrae differed from typical crocodile elements in being opisthocoel: convex in front and concave behind.</p><p>The specific name refers to Altdorf where some teleosaurid remains had also been found.</p><p>Von Meyer\'s name was the first binomial name (also) referring to a theropod.</p><p>In 1842 Richard Owen pointed out that von Meyer had been incorrect in changing the original specific name and created the correct combination Streptospondylus rostromajor for Streptospondylus altdorfensis.</p><p>At the same time he created a second species: Streptospondylus cuvieri based on a single damaged vertebra from the Bajocian, found near Chipping Norton.</p><p>In 1861, Owen would refer the entire Cuvier material to S. cuvieri, despite the fact that if it were cospecific the name S. rostromajor would have priority.</p><p>From that time S. cuvieri was generally accepted in the literature as the valid name, though some workers split off the theropod remains from the crocodilian bones, Edward Drinker Cope in 1867 naming a Laelaps gallicus and Friedrich von Huene in 1909 a Megalosaurus cuvieri.</p><p>In 1964, Alick Donald Walker discovered Owen\'s mistake, referring the entire theropod material to the new species Eustreptospondylus divesensis which, however, had a skull not belonging to the Cuvier material as the type specimen, MNHN 1920-7.</p><p>In 1977 Philippe Taquet created the genus Piveteausaurus for this species.</p><p>In 2001, Ronan Allain concluded that no connection could be proven between Piveteausaurus and the referred other theropod material from Normandy.</p><p>He also pointed out that the skull von Meyer had based Streptospondylus altdorfensis on was in fact a composite of bones from two species, since named Steneosaurus edwardsi Deslongchamps 1866 and Metriorynchus superciliosum Blainville 1853 (Steel 1973).</p><p>A lectotype had never been chosen from one of the composite parts to give the name Streptospondylus priority over either one of these species.</p><p>Allain used this situation to remove all the crocodilian material from the Streptospondylus type by designating the complete (postcranial) theropod material as the lectotype.</p><p>As Steneosaurus rostromajor had been based on the composite skull, the epithet rostromajor now no longer had priority over altdorfensis.</p><p>This way in 2001 Streptospondylus altdorfensis became the valid name and type species of a theropod.</p><p>Laelaps gallicus and Megalosaurus cuvieri are its objective junior synonyms.</p><p>The lectotype specimens, MNHN 8605-09, 8787-89, 8793-94, 8907, were probably found at the coast in layers of the Falaises des Vaches Noires near Calvados, dating from the late Callovian or early Oxfordian, about 161 million years old.</p><p>They consist of several vertebrae series, single vertebrae, a partial left pubis and limb elements.</p><p>The longest vertebra has a length of 97 millimetres, indicating a total body length of about seven metres.</p><p>Also a partial left femur, MNHN 9645, has been referred.</p><p>Streptospondylus has been diagnosed by several osteological details, among which the possession of two hypapophyses on the, ventrally flat, anterior dorsal vertebrae and the particular connection between the astragalus and the tibia, without a posterior astragalar process but with a distinctive buttress on the tibia above the anterior process.</p><p>Owen also named two other species, S. major (S. recentior is a museum label for syntype specimens ) and S. meyeri, of which the former is based on iguanodont material.</p><p>His S. cuvieri, of which the type specimen is lost, is today considered a nomen dubium.</p><p>In 2010 Gregory S.</p><p>Paul renamed (as an informal name) Magnosaurus into Streptospondylus nethercombensis.</p><p>Earlier assigned to crocodilian groups, Streptospondylus was in the 20th century typically classified in the Megalosauridae.</p><p>Recent analyses indicate that Streptospondylus is a tetanuran theropod.</p><p>Allain in 2001 suggested that it was closely related to Eustreptospondylus in the Spinosauroidea.</p><p>Roger Benson in 2008 and 2010 concluded that whether it is a megalosauroid, allosauroid, or a more primitive form cannot be determined because of its extremely fragmentary remains.</p><p>Later cladistic analysis by Benson and colleagues from 2010 indicated that Streptospondylus was the sister species of Magnosaurus within the Megalosauridae.</p><p>Carrano et al.

and Deinocheirus living from 71 to 69 mya.</p><p>When originally named, Halszka Osmólska and Ewa Roniewicz, found that Deinocheirus was a carnosaurian, and because of its extremely unusual arms, named

(Carnosauria at the time was a paraphyletic group of all large theropods).</p><p>Previously, the only carnosaurian from that time and place in Asia was the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus.</p><p>Osmólska

the Upper Cretaceous of the Upper Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert, China.</p><p>Osmólska and Roniewicz noted, however, that the features of this family were very similar to those of Ornithomimus,

appreciably tidally heated.</p><p>Callisto\'s rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that the same hemisphere always faces inward.</p><p>Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian

sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material.</p><p>This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants.</p><p>The absolute ages of the landforms are not

planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.</p><p>Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p><p>Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.</p><p>Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).</p><p>It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune\'s trident.</p><p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.</p><p>Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.</p><p>The position of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard\'s observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death.</p><p>Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier.</p><p>Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet\'s remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.</p><p>The planet\'s distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.</p><p>Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.</p><p>The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.</p><p>Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune\'s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of <em>ices</em> such as water, ammonia and methane.</p><p>However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered <em>ice giants</em> to emphasise this distinction.</p><p>Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet\'s blue appearance.</p><p>In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune\'s atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns.</p><p>For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet\'s southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.</p><p>These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).</p><p>Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune\'s outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F).</p><p>Temperatures at the planet\'s centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).</p><p>Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled <em>arcs</em>), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.</p></section><section name=\"soft schools\"><p>Neptune was discovered by Urbain Le Verrier and

of the most widespread of all birds.','<text><section name=\"wikipedia\"><p>The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the most widely distributed species of owl and one of the most widespread of all birds.</p><p>It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae).</p><p>The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, in Asia north of the Himalaya, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.</p><p>Phylogenetic evidence shows that there are at least three major lineages of barn owl, one in Europe, western Asia and Africa, one in southeast Asia and Australasia, and one in the Americas, and some highly divergent taxa on islands.</p><p>Accordingly, some authorities split the group into the western barn owl for the group in Europe, western Asia and Africa, the American barn owl for the group in the Americas, and the eastern barn owl for the group in southeast Asia and Australasia.</p><p>Some taxonomic authorities further split the group, recognising up to five species, and further research needs to be done to clarify the position.</p><p>There is a considerable variation between the sizes and colour of the approximately 28 subspecies but most are between 33 and 39 cm (13 and 15 in) in length with wingspans ranging from 80 to 95 cm (31 to 37 in).</p><p>The plumage on head and back is a mottled shade of grey or brown, the underparts vary from white to brown and are sometimes speckled with dark markings.</p><p>The face is characteristically heart-shaped and is white in most subspecies.</p><p>This owl does not hoot, but utters an eerie, drawn-out screech.</p><p>The barn owl is nocturnal over most of its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day.</p><p>Barn owls specialise in hunting animals on the ground and nearly all of their food consists of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute.</p><p>They usually mate for life unless one of the pair is killed, when a new pair bond may be formed.</p><p>Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to the locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff.</p><p>The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food.</p><p>When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern.</p><p>Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.</p></section></text>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0),(730,2,'CREATED','2020-04-05 22:10:23','bison-bison','Bison','Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus Bison

occidentalis, was succeeded at 3,000 BC by B. bison.</p><p>Of the two surviving species, the American bison, B. bison, found only in North America, is the more numerous.</p><p>Although commonly known as a buffalo in the United States and Canada, it is only distantly related to the true buffalo.</p><p>The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the Plains bison, B. b. bison, and the wood bison, B. b. athabascae, which is the namesake of Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.</p><p>A third subspecies, the eastern bison (B. b. pennsylvanicus) is no longer considered a valid taxon, being a junior synonym of B. b. bison.</p><p>References to <em>woods bison</em> or <em>wood bison</em> from the eastern United States confusingly refer to this subspecies, not B. b. athabascae, which was not found in the region.</p><p>The European bison, B. bonasus, or wisent, is found in Europe and the Caucasus, reintroduced after being extinct in the wild.</p><p>While all bison species are classified in their own genus, they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus Bos) and produce sometimes fertile offspring called beefalo or

for many of the aircraft\'s innovative concepts.</p><p>The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section.</p><p>At one point, a bomber variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance.</p><p>Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit.</p><p>The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconaissance).</p><p>The aircraft was introduced to operational service in January 1966.</p><p>During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes (85,000 feet, 25,900 meters) to allow it to outrace threats.</p><p>If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.</p><p>On average,

action.</p><p>During 1988, the USAF retired the SR-71 largely due to political reasons; several were briefly reactivated during the 1990s before their second retirement in 1998.</p><p>NASA was the

Tetraodontidae, which are more commonly given this name.\r\n\r\nPorcupinefish are medium- to large-sized fish, and are found in shallow temperate and tropical seas worldwide.\r\n\r\nA few species are found much further out from shore, wherein large schools of thousands of individuals can occur.\r\n\r\nThey are generally slow-moving.\r\n\r\nPorcupinefish have the ability to inflate their bodies by swallowing water or air, thereby becoming rounder.\r\n\r\nThis increase in size (almost double vertically) reduces the range of potential predators to those with much bigger mouths.\r\n\r\nA second defense mechanism is provided by the sharp spines, which radiate outwards when the fish is inflated.\r\n\r\nSome species are poisonous, having tetrodotoxin in their internal organs, such as the ovaries and liver.\r\n\r\nThis neurotoxin is at least 1200 times more potent than cyanide.\r\n\r\nThe poison is produced by several types of bacteria obtained from the fish\'s diet.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these three defenses, porcupinefish have few predators, although adults are sometimes preyed upon by sharks and killer whales.\r\n\r\nJuveniles are also preyed on by Lysiosquillina maculata, tuna,

the fall of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868.</p><p>In the resulting Meiji period, Japan adopted a Western-style government and pursued a program of industrialization and
